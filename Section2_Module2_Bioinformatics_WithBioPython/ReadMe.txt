If you need to reconnect to Jupyter Lab simply type the following into terminal and press enter:


jupyter lab




Notes:


-Each video is either called a video or a subsection. 

-I tried to consolidate each subsection into 1 Jupyter Notebook. This is different from the instructor who used 1 Jupter Notebook for all the subsections.



Subsections That Have Issues & Cannot Be Uploaded At All/Only In Part:
