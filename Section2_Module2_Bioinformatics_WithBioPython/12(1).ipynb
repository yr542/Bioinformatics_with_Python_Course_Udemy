    "\n",
    "+ A dot plot is a graphical methods that allows the comparison of 2 biological seqences and identify regions of close similarity between them\n",
    "+ Simplest method - put a dot wherever sequences are identical\n",
    "+ Dot plots compare 2 sequences by organizing 1 sequence on the x axis and another on the y axis\n",
    "+ When the residues of both sequences match at the same location on the plot, a dot is drawn at the corresponding position\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usefulness\n",

    "+ Dot plots can also be used to visually inspect sequences for\n",
